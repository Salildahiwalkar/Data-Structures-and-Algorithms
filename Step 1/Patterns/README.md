# âœ¨ Pattern Printing with C++ â€“ Striver's DSA Sheet (Patterns Section)

This repository contains my C++ implementations of **pattern printing problems** as part of my journey through the [Striver's DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/). This section focuses on building a strong grasp of **loops, nested iterations, and logic building**, which are crucial for cracking beginner-level to intermediate-level coding interviews.

## ðŸ“‚ File Overview

- **File**: `patterns.cpp`
- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Stars and number-based patterns
  - Character pyramids and triangle patterns
  - Symmetric patterns using spaces and alignment
  - Mirror patterns and hollow structures

Each pattern is implemented using a **separate function** with a descriptive name, making it easy to read, test, and expand further.

## ðŸ“Œ List of Pattern Functions

| Function Name        | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `print1` to `print6` | Basic square, triangle, and number sequences |
| `print7` to `print10`| Symmetric pyramids and diamonds |
| `print11`            | Binary triangle pattern |
| `print12`            | Number pyramid with center spacing |
| `print13`            | Incrementing number triangle |
| `print14` to `print18`| Alphabet and pyramid-based character patterns |
| `print19`, `print20` | Hourglass and butterfly patterns |
| `print21`            | Hollow square border |
| `print22`            | Concentric number square |

> You can call any of these functions by passing a value of `n` to see the respective pattern.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Strivers-DSA-Sheet.git
cd Strivers-DSA-Sheet
```

2. Compile and run:
```bash
g++ patterns.cpp -o patterns
./patterns
```

3. Enter a value of `n` when prompted.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Pattern Problems?

Pattern problems are essential for:
- Mastering **nested loops**
- Improving **visual and spatial logic**
- Building a strong foundation in **C++ basics**
